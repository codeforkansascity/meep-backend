'''There are two base classes for resources. The first is BaseAPI, and has GET,
PUT, AND DELETE HTTP methods attached to it. The second is BaseListAPI, which
has a GET method for lists of records, and a POST method for a single record.
The reason the methods were organized into resources in this manner is that
all of the methods attached to the BaseAPI object take an id parameter, while
the methods registered with the BaseListAPI object take no url parameters.

To define an api class, just subclass BaseAPI and provide model and output_fields
as class attributes
